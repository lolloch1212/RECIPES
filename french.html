<p class="recipe description">
    This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
    <br>
     made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously 
     <br>
     cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade 
     <br>

     lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's
      recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      <br>
     I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a
      leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
